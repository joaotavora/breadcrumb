;;; Commentary:
;;
;;;; Usage:
;;
;; Breadcrumbs are sequences of short strings indicating where you
;; are in some big tree-like maze.
;;
;; To craft these strings, this library uses the maps provided by
;; project.el and Imenu, respectively.  Project breadcrumbs shows you
;; the current buffer's path in a large project.  Imenu breadcrumbs
;; show the current position of point in the buffer's nested
;; structure of programming constructs (for example, a specific
;; functions within multiple C++ nested namespaces).
;;
;; To use this library:
;;
;; * `M-x breadcrumb-mode` is a global mode.  Will try to turn itself
;;   on conservatively and only if there's a project.
;;
;; * `M-x breadcrumb-local-mode` is a buffer-local minor mode, if you
;;    don't want the default heuristics for turning it on everywhere.
;;
;; * Manually put the mode-line constructs
;;
;;     (:eval (breadcrumb-imenu-crumbs))
;;
;;   and
;;
;;     (:eval (breadcrumb-project-crumbs))
;;
;;  in your settings of the `mode-line-format' or
;;  `header-line-format' variables.
;;
;; The shape and size of each breadcrumb groups may be tweaked via
;; `breadcrumb-imenu-max-length', `breadcrumb-project-max-length',
;; `breadcrumb-imenu-crumb-separator', and
;; `breadcrumb-project-crumb-separator'.
;;
;; The structure each the breadcrumbs varies depending on whether
;; either project.el and imenu.el (or both) can do useful things for
;; your buffer.
;;
;; For Project breadcrumbs, this depends on whether project.el's
;; `project-current' can guess what project the current buffer
;; belongs to.
;;
;; For Imenu breadcrumbs, this varies.  Depending on the major-mode
;; author's taste, the Imenu tree (in variable `imenu--index-alist')
;; may have different structure.  Sometimes, minor mode also tweak
;; the Imenu tree in useful ways.  For example, with recent Eglot (I
;; think Eglot 1.14+), managed buffers get extra region info added to
;; it, which makes Breadcrumb show "richer" paths.
;;
;;;; Implementation notes:
;;
;; This _should_ be faster than which-func.el due some caching
;; strategies.  One of these strategies occurs in `bc--ipath-alist',
;; which takes care not to over-call `imenu--make-index-alist', which
;; could be slow (in fact very slow if an external process needs to
;; be contacted).  The variable `breadcrumb-idle-delay' controls
;; that.  Another cache occurs in `bc--ipath-plain-cache' second is
;; just a simple "space-for-speed" cache.
;;
;; Breadcrumb uses the double-dashed Imenu symbols
;; `imenu--index-alist' and `imenu--make-index-alist'.  There's
;; really no official API here.  It's arguable that, despite the
;; name, these aren't really internal symbols (the much older
;; which-func.el library makes liberal use of them, for example).
;;
;;;; Todo:
;;
;; Make more clicky buttons in the headerline to do whatever
